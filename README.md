A Free and Open-Source Discord Bot with Premium and Advanced Features with a local dashboard

## About

This is a bot I started purely for fun. The bot is fully coded in python with an added dashboard coded in Discord Flask. If you have any features or any bugs check the issue template. More features will be added soon! Check the roadmap on what I'm planning to add.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Lavalink 4 (**You can use a server instead of using a local server, But make sure the server has LavaSrc for Spotify Support.**)

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file and refer to the `.env.example` for all environment variables
2. Install all dependancies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Once installed all the dependancies run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py`

## Roadmap

More features will be added into the roadmap once the ideas start flowing in. (Yes I know very ambitious)
