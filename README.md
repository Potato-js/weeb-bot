A Free and Open-Source Discord Bot with Premium and Advanced Features with a local dashboard

## NOTE: The dashboard is STILL a WIP DO NOT USE IT

Since I'm still working on how the dashboard will work right now it's just a rough login page with servers you are in.

## About

This is a bot I started purely for fun. The bot is fully coded in python with an added dashboard coded in Discord Flask. If you have any features or any bugs check the issue template. More features will be added soon! Check the roadmap on what I'm planning to add.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or higher
- ~~Lavalink 4 (**You can use a server instead of using a local server**)~~ **Work in progress feature

## Setup

1. Create a `.env` file and refer to the `.env.example` for all environment variables
2. Install all dependancies using `pip install -r requirements.txt` or `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
3. Once installed all the dependancies run `python main.py` or `python3 main.py` ~~and `python dashboard.py` or `python3 dashboard.py` to run the dashboard if you are using any leveling modules or fake perms.~~ **WORK IN PROGRESS FEATURE**

## Roadmap

More features will be added into the roadmap once the ideas start flowing in. (Yes I know very ambitious)
